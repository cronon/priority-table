The main purpose is to sort items manually with bubble-sort by various aspects.

Copy a list of tickets or other items, put cursor to the New row input, press Ctrl+V. You'll see the list of your items each item in a separate row.

Now you can add columns that will represent various aspects of your items. The currently sorting column is marked with blue outline over its heading. Sort rows with +/- buttons or by draggin a row by its # button. When you finish sorting by one aspect, click on another aspect. The rows will appear sorted according to it. Now you can your rows according to it.

When you finish, you can select everything by mouse and copy and paste it to Excel.
